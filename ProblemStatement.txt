Hi Nilav, nice speaking to you. Please find below the exercise I mentioned.  Please do not forward. Realise you have exams shortly so please keep me updated on how you get on and don’t hesitate to get in touch with any queries.

Earthquake visualisation exercise

Implement the following in Python.  Follow the same practices you would apply to production-standard code.

1)      Take a look at this site for the US Geological Service Rest API for earthquakes.  These APIs are publically available and free to use.

2)      Create a request that returns all earthquake data for Jan 2016  in geojson format

3)      Call this request from Python and store the results in a suitable Python data structure.

4)      Extend the code to pick up all earthquake data for 2016 – note this cannot be done in a single call, as there is a limit of 20,000 events per request

5)      Use a suitable Python visualisation library e.g. matplotlib, to visualise the data. Use your creativity and see whether there are any conclusions you can draw from the data

Preferred Python version is 3.4 or above.

Notes – it is very easy to write Python code quickly that doesn’t work in a production situation. In particular I will be looking for any techniques used to make the code of production quality.  I will also be looking for creativity in visualisation. Finally the development team use Pandas. If you are able to adapt to demonstrate use of Pandas Dataframes, that is a bonus.
